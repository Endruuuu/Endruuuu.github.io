		<p>I like reading books, like comics and novels, especially action, fantasy, and romantic genres. I really love listening to music, I like pop, RnG, or EDM music from another country. Playing games are one of my hobbies but my parents don't like it, so I'm playing a bit less now. My new hobby is related to my parents who don't like me playing games. So in my spare time, I learn web programming, and I can do it a little already.</p>

		<p>I already finished high school now, and I'm in college now. I was studying at Universitas Katolik De La Salle Manado and got the highest IPK, 4. Thank God for that.</p>
